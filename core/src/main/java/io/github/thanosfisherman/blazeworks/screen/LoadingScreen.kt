         *  Optimize loadingPermalink
         * In order to perform loading as efficiently/fast as possible while trying to keep a certain FPS, AssetManager.update() should be called with parameters.
         * E.g. AssetManager.update(17) - In this case the AssetManager blocks for at least 17 milliseconds (only less if all assets are loaded) and loads as many assets as possible,
         * before it returns control back to the render method. Blocking for 16 or 17 milliseconds leads to ~60FPS as 1/60*1000 = 16.66667.
         * Note that it might block for longer, depending on the asset that is being loaded so donâ€™t take the desired FPS as guaranteed.
